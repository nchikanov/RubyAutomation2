    Given I navigate to the external "flights" site
    When I set the radio button to "<type of flight>"
    And I set the "Where are you going" fields with "<starting point>" value and "<ending point>" value
    And I select a date from the datepicker on the "dep" section

    #Question: Why did I have to do childrenage_combobox1 and 2...had to specify which box but you didn't?
    #Question: What is the point of "within"? Does this just restrict it to one block of code?
    #Question: Unrelated to Children -- ask about why you can't use @mainpage functions within @bookflightspage and vice versa. Any way to change to make them public to all?
   #Or do you have to keep remaking the functions w appropriate values for each new page (like bookcarspage and bookflights page have same functions w/ different elements)
    And I set the "Children Age" fields with "child in lap" value and "child in seat" value
